### **<ins> Build Instructions <ins>**
1- Make sure you have [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) installed and linked properly.

2- I used [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) + [CMake](https://cmake.org/) + [mingw-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) to create this project.

3- Open the project with CLion, build (F7 in my case) and play :)

4- Have fun.
